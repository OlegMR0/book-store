# Book StoreðŸ“š - Your Ultimate Digital Library

RESTful application that allows users or admins to authenticate, interact with books and make orders. 

Service has different activities depending on your role. 
Starting from registration where your encrypted credentials will be securely saved in MySQL database.
The authentication process ensures convenience and safety providing JWT token upon successful login. 
This token serves in an arranged period, that can be initialized manually, as your key to future requests, authorizing your interactions.

Looking further users can explore available books, filtering them by specific parameters, including categories you wish and eventually have an opportunity to collect all liked books to the shopping cart, where customer can see or edit all items. Once you're ready, you can place the order and then check the existing ones with detailed info.

While for the admins offers complete control, so this role enables you to manage books and categories, with the ability to create, edit or delete them in a convenient way. The same applies to orders, which you can accompany during the entire process till completely delivered.
> [!NOTE]
> The admin also has all features available to users.
